### PROJECT: Responsive website

In this project you're going to rebuild `the homepage` of an existing responsive website. Choose one of the following:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Uber](https://www.uber.com/nl/nl/)
- [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [Triodos](https://www.triodos.nl/)

You don't have to build everything, but include the following requirements:

- Create a completely new repository on your GitHub for your website, you can name it _WEBSITENAME-copy_
- Create an `index.html` to make your HTML
- Design-wise it should be similar so the fonts, icons, text, etc. should look the same as the original
- Only rebuild the homepage (which should include a navigation bar, footer, the landing section and at least 2 other sections. A section is one part of the website that contains information and that needs to adjust based on the screen size. A list of company logo's or a single button is not considered a section!)
- Write your CSS in an external stylesheet
- Make use of `flexbox`
- Download the assets (images, other forms of media) through the original webpage!
- Use media queries for both tablet and mobile (This might be same for the website you're making)
- Deploy your website using Github Pages! It is very similar to what you did before.

### Optional: Flexbox games

If you like learning in a fun way there are quite a few games on the internet that teach you the way flexbox works:
